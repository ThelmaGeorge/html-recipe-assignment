            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook spaghetti according to package directions until <em>al dente</em>. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
                <li>While pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced guanciale and cook for 8-10 minutes until <strong>golden and crispy</strong>. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, grated cheeses, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add the hot, drained pasta to the skillet with the guanciale. Toss quickly to combine and let cool slightly for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Remove skillet from heat completely. Slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta while tossing vigorously. Add pasta water gradually until you achieve a <u>creamy, silky sauce</u> that coats each strand.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately in warmed bowls, topped with additional grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Chef's Tips</h2>
        <p><strong>Temperature is key:</strong> Make sure to remove the pan from heat before adding the egg mixture to prevent scrambling. The residual heat from the pasta and pan will cook the eggs gently. If the sauce seems too thick, add more pasta water gradually. For the most authentic flavor, use guanciale instead of pancetta, and never add cream - the creaminess comes from the emulsified eggs and cheese!</p>
